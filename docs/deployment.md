# Deployment Notes

General Django deployment considerations apply to deploying Cove. We deploy using Apache and uwsgi using this  [Salt State file](https://github.com/OpenDataServices/opendataservices-deploy/blob/master/salt/cove.sls).

## Before a live deploy

Travis tests will fail if a branch isn't ready to be merged and deployed. This includes if OCDS translations are missing.

## How to do a live deploy of CoVE

### OCDS

1. Do the actual deploy. From the [opendataservices-deploy directory](https://github.com/OpenDataServices/opendataservices-deploy):

```
salt-ssh --state-output=mixed -L 'cove-live-ocds-2' state.highstate
```
2. Check that the latest commit is shown in the footer of <http://standard.open-contracting.org/review/>

3. Test that the live site is working as expected. From the cove directory:

```
CUSTOM_SERVER_URL=http://standard.open-contracting.org/ DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=cove_ocds.settings py.test cove_ocds/tests_functional.py -n 4
```
