We have chosen 7 days as a practical time frame that allows people to share results with colleagues, but also allows data to disappear over time to save people having to clean up after themselves.{% endblocktrans %}</p>
        <p>{% blocktrans %}We believe that deleting supplied data after 7 days provides a level of privacy for the users of this service. {% endblocktrans %}</p>
